# Project-Euler-no.1
First try at the Project Euler problem number 1.  (sum of all natural numbers below 1000 that are multiples of 3 or 5). Written in JS.

I know little about programming and ended up starting to learn JS b/c of Codecademy.  

I hate being a n00b at anything so I'm hating this right now.
